1st semester Web dev bachelor mandatory assignment.

Description:
Create a multipage website for Restaurant KEA so that it looks as in the attached pictures (restaurant_design.zip).

Apply all concepts covered in class. Pay special attention to

*The use of semantic HTML, especially in regard to landmark elements
*Exclusive use of relative paths
*Use of HTML5 syntax rather than XHTML syntax
*Use of character entities
*Use of CSS custom properties for all colours and font families
*Avoidance of pixel units in favour of relative units when possible
*Loading of fonts in CSS rather than HTML
*Responsiveness can be implemented through normal flow, floats and media queries alone, but feel free to use flexbox and/or grid.

Find the assets attached in restaurant_assets.zip.
